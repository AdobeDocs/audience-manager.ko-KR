# Time Zones in Audience Manager{#time-zones-in-audience-manager}

Audience Manager는 전체 UI에서 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) 를 사용합니다.

Unless otherwise specified, all the dates and date ranges you can select in the [!DNL Adobe] [!DNL Audience Manager] UI are [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc). For example, in the [Create Destination](../features/destinations/manage-destinations.md#segment-mappings) flow, when mapping segments to your destination, the start and end date you select are midnight UTC. The same applies for all the dates in [!DNL Audience Manager].
